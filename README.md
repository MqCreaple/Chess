# Chess

School AP computer science project.

## Creating a chess bot

1. Create a new class under `/utils/bot` folder, name whatever you like.
2. Extend the class from `ChessBot`. Then, extend the constructor with parameter types exactly the same as parent class.
3. Override the `getMove()` function in your class. Write your code here.
4. De-comment the commented code in `Main` class, then replace all `YourChessBot` with the name of class you created.
5. Test your code. If there is any bug with the template, please contact @MqCreaple.
